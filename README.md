ShotbowForumAPI
===============

Shotbow Forum API for logging in, making posts, and tracking data.

I plan on working on this a lot. I do plan on being at a "Finished State" at one point, though.


THINGS TO BE DONE:
- Logging in
- Page, Thread, and Post Objects
- Sending private message
- Posting on profile page
- Posting on thread
- Getting thread data
- Getting forum data
- Setup Queue
- Read Queue

THINGS MAYBE TO BE DONE:
- Getting post likes
- Liking a post

NOTICES:
- Redirects are ignored
- Non-existent data does not give errors, it just is left as "null"
